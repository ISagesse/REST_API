# REST_API
This is my REST API I created using mongoose, node.js, express.js.

It contains article that I have learned.

you can use get, post, delete, put, and path.

to run this app cd into that project folder, run npm i and node app.js.

if you have mongoDB install or compass it will create this database when you go to http://localhost:3000/articles if not you will get an error in the comand line.
